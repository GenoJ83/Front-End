            <p>Web development involves creating and maintaining websites and web applications that
               are accessible through the internet. It encompasses front-end development, which 
               focuses on the visual and interactive aspects of a website using languages like <i>HTML,
                CSS, and JavaScript</i>, and back-end development, which handles server-side operations, 
               databases, and application logic using languages such as Python, <b>Node.js</b>, and PHP. 
               Full-stack development combines both front-end and back-end expertise. 
               <br>Modern web development often involves the use of frameworks, libraries,
               and tools like React, Angular, and Django to streamline the process and <u>improve efficiency</u>.
               With the growing emphasis on user experience, security, and performance, web development 
               continues to evolve, driving digital innovation across industries.</br></p> <!--The paragraph of the webpage-->
